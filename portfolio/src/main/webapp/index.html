      <p>Hello I was born in El Paso Texas and have lived all my life in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico. I like hearing people and helping them alleviate their stress, when possible. I like learning new stuff and getting good at it.</p>
      <p>I do not have that much of experience in technical projects regarding computer science. I had an internship with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I was in charge of the data visualization of a repository from New York's Health Department  reagrding COVID 19. Also, this spring I am participating in Google's TEch Exchange program.</p>
